### Android (via Termux + Termux:X11)

#### Requirements

- [Termux](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/)
- [Termux:X11](https://github.com/termux/termux-x11)

#### Install dependencies

In Termux:

```bash
pkg install cmake clang sdl3 glm
```

#### Build & Run

In the project directory, run:

```bash
bash DesktopMake.sh -termux
